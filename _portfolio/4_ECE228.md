- **Who**: the group project (3 people including myself)
  - I was in charge of preliminary CNN test section and result analysis.
  - Other 2 people were in charge of machine learning and transfer learning section, respectively.
- **When**: Mar. 2020 - June 2020
- **Where**: ECE228 (Machine Learning for Physical Applications) group project
- **What**: Classification of defective PV cells in Electroluminescence images (@ 6-inch, industrial level)
  - **Dataset**: [Open source in Github](https://github.com/zae-bayern/elpv-dataset)
- **How**: Python. OpenCV. TensorFlow 2.x. Keras data augmentation.
- **Learn**: TensorFlow 2.x usage. Image data augmentation libraries. Building vanilla CNN models from the scratch. Trnansfer learning. KAZE descriptor.
- [The repository](https://github.com/haenara-shin/ECE228_Proejct.git) is now opened for the public.
  - It will be back to the private in June 2021. Please contact me if you want to see in detail.
