- This is the solo- & side-project that I participated in the [DACON Computer Vision Learning open competition](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/235626/overview/) for AI/ML, section in "Find the hidden numbers behind characters in EMNIST".
- This project was written in TensorFlow 2.x. All EDA and preliminary ML approach are included. 
- The dataset comes from EMNIST (open to the public, but simply downloadable from DACON website).
- Through transfer learning models provided from Tensorflow without using pre-trained weights (this was the rule of competition), I hitted the 21st-rank before 14 days to the deadline of submission
  - Finally, I was ranked at 49th among 876 participants (solo and group). This is because I didn't use the Ensemble model, just used the transfer learning models without pre-trained weights, and stopped submission of updated codes (family issues).
  - The Top winner codes used the ensemble models.
- [The repository](https://github.com/haenara-shin/DACON_EMNIST.git) is under the private. Please contact me if you want to see in detail.
