- **Who**: the solo- & side-project
- **When**: July 2020 - Aug. 2020
- **Where**: [DACON Computer Vision Learning open competition](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/235626/overview/) for AI/ML, section in "Find the hidden numbers behind characters in EMNIST".
  - **Dataset**: [Dacon dataset EMNIST](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/235626/data/)
- **What**: Prediction the hidden numbers behind characters images
- **How**: TensorFlow 2.x. Implementation of ResNet121, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3 from the scratch without pre-trained weights. 
- **Learn**: SOTA models' structures. Ensemble/Stacking method & Customized loss from winner codes. EDA and preliminary ML apporaches from the scratch.

- Through SOTA model evaluations without using pre-trained weights, I ranked the 21st-rank before 14 days to the deadline of submission, and I ranked at 49th of Private LB among 1185 participants. This is because I didn't use the Ensemble/stacking models, and stopped submission by updating codes (due to family issues).
- The winner codes used the ensemble/stacking methods.
- [The repository](https://github.com/haenara-shin/DACON_EMNIST.git) is opened to the public. My own codes were written in UCSD-Datahub server, but forgot to download it from there, so it was deleted.
