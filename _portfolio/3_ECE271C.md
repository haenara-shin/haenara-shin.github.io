- This is the repository of 7 labs in ECE271C course (Deep Learning and Applications).
- This course has 7 labs instead of a Midterm, Quizzes, and a Final exam. This means the 7 labs, which have mathematical and coding problem, are very challengeable and difficult.
- [The repository](https://github.com/haenara-shin/ECE271C.git) is under the private. I cannot open it to the public or students because the professor does not allow.
