- **Who**: the solo- & side-project
- **When**: June 2021 - present
- **Where**: [Kaggle Image Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-covid19-detection) SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection
  - **Dataset**: [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-covid19-detection/data)
- **What**:  Identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, categorize the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19.
- **How**: PyTorch. EfficientNet7(classification) + Yolo-v5(Detection). EfficientNet2(classification) + CascadeRCNN(Detection).
- **Learn**: Image detection. 

- **Note_1**: It's still going on. The repos. and report will be posted after the competition (Aug 6 2021). I am now (July 28 2021) ranked at 223/1164.

- Through SOTA model evaluations without using pre-trained weights, I ranked the 21st-rank before 14 days to the deadline of submission, and I ranked at 49th of Private LB among 876 participants. This is because I didn't use the Ensemble/stacking models, and stopped submission by updating codes (due to family issues).
- The winner codes used the ensemble/stacking methods.
- [The repository](https://github.com/haenara-shin/DACON_EMNIST.git) is opened to the public. My own codes were written in UCSD-Datahub server, but forgot to download it from there, so it was deleted.
