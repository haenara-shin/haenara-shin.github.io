- **Who**: the group project (2 people including myself)
  - I was in charge of writing proposal, all codes, writing final report, and making PPT slides.
- **When**: Jan. 2020 - Mar. 2020
- **Where**: ECE271B (Statistical Learning II) group project
- **What**: Building the deep learning model to classify the dataset as Pass/Fail - Binary classification
  - **Dataset**: [AITEX](https://www.aitex.es/afid) company open source dataset.
- **How**: Python. OpenCV. TensorFlow 2.x. TFRecord. Data augmentation (image flipping, rotation, translation). From vanilla CNNs to Inception-like CNN models without pre-trained weights.
- **Learn**: TensorFlow 2.x usage. TFRecord. Inception-like CNN structure building. Data augmentation (manually). 
- [The repository](https://github.com/haenara-shin/ECE271B.git) is under the private. Please contact me if you want to see in detail.
