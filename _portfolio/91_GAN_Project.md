- **Who**: the team & side-project
  * [@jiyoon baek](https://github.com/jiyoonbaekbaek) - She was our project leader. Our key idea came from her, and she tested other possible models. Also, she devoted to PPT and presented our result. Her presentation was very smooth and impressive to judges. 
  * [@seungwon song](https://github.com/sw-song) - He implemented our final & successful GAN model and inspired many points in this project. His keen sight and sense were one of key points for our succeesful result.
  * [@haenara shin](https://github.com/haenara-shin) - I verified the human face aging models that wered turned out those were not suitable for us, and wrote the inference python file and docker file to submit the committee. Many thanks to our team members!
- **When**: May 2021 - Sept 2021
- **Brife summary**
  * Group (3 people) project of '2021 Deep Learning AI Competition in South Korea' 
  * Base structure: StyleGAN2-Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation (ADA) (written in PyTorch)
  * Using GAN(StyleGAN2-ADA), showed the rejuvenation of the adult dog based on the continuous time-flow changing.
- Result: 🎉Won a contest (1st place: Awarded for the Commissioner of the Korean Intellectual Property Office Award - '특허청장상' in Korean)🎉

- Will be updated soon in detail or please visit [our repos.](https://github.com/haenara-shin/GAN_Project) and give a star🌟!
