- **Who**: the solo- & side-project
- **When**: June 2021 - Aug 2021 (completed)
- **Where**: [Kaggle Image Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-covid19-detection) SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection
  - **Dataset**: [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-covid19-detection/data)
- **What**:  Identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, categorize the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19.
- **How**: PyTorch. EfficientNet7(classification) + Yolo-v5(Detection). EfficientNet2(classification) + CascadeRCNN(Detection). EfficientNetv2 + DCN(FasterRCNN)
- **Learn**: Image detection. 

- **Result_1**: It's done (Aug. 9, 2021). I finally ranked at 97/1324 (Top 8% - Bronze medal). I know it's all my fault, however, the bronze medal was retracted and my account on this competition was deleted because I made two accounts on this competition(the 2nd account's name was 'Running_on_Datasets' which was ranked at 100/1324), in order to overcome the computing power and submission limits. I admit I violated the competition rule which I was not aware of that.
- **Result_2**: ![스크린샷 2021-08-09 오후 7 46 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58493928/128800584-f3748867-474f-4fcc-8a42-3e1f1b7c199d.png)
- **Result_3**: ![스크린샷 2021-08-09 오후 7 41 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58493928/128800242-42e30f9b-159f-4a3c-8930-20f20839cac6.png)

- Through SOTA model evaluations without using pre-trained weights, I ranked the 21st-rank before 14 days to the deadline of submission, and I ranked at 49th of Private LB among 876 participants. This is because I didn't use the Ensemble/stacking models, and stopped submission by updating codes (due to family issues).
- The winner codes used the ensemble/stacking methods.
- [The repository](https://github.com/haenara-shin/DACON_EMNIST.git) is opened to the public. My own codes were written in UCSD-Datahub server, but forgot to download it from there, so it was deleted.
