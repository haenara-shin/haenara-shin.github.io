- **Who**: the solo project 
- **When**: Mar. 2020 - June 2020
- **Where**: COGS225 (Image Recognition) solo project
- **What**: Dog/Cat breeds images classification, localization, and segmentation with transfer learning, multitask learning, and cut-mix data augmentation.
  - **Dataset**: The dataset comes from [Oxford Pet dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) (open to the public).
- **How**: Python. TensorFlow 2.x OpenCV. Pre-trained weights SOTA models in TensorFlow. Cut-mix image augmentation. Learning rate scheduler. 
- **Learn**: All the class assignments were requested writing in PyTorch, but this project was written in TensorFlow 2.x. Transfer learning from TensorFlow. SOTA models, augmentation skills and learning rate control. Multitask learning. IoU. U-net structure for image segmentation. 
 
- [The repository](https://github.com/haenara-shin/COGS225.git) is now opened for the public.
  - It will be back to the private in June 2021. Please contact me if you want to see in detail.
