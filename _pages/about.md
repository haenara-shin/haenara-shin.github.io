I finally received the second MS degree for the Machine Learning and Data Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California San Diego (UCSD), class of 2021. 

I obtained my first MS for Materials Science and Engineering from KAIST in 2011, and BS for Materials Science and Engineering from KAIST in 2009, minored in Chemistry. From 2011 to 2015, I worked at the PV industry as a researcher who was in charge of the thin-film deposition, the defect/passivation analysis, and the high-efficient p/n-type c-Si solar cells fabrication.

As my second MS, in Machine Learning and Data Science track of Electrical and Computer Engineering department from UCSD, I graduated in June 2021. During my new journey to ML/DL, I have done several [projects](https://haenara-shin.github.io/portfolio/) and [courses](https://haenara-shin.github.io/cv/) as [ceritified Google TensorFlow Developer](https://api.accredible.com/v1/frontend/credential_website_embed_image/certificate/20943431). Now, I am actively looking for the full-time position as a software developer specialized in Machine Learning and Deep Learning while I have enjoyed [Image detection Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-covid19-detection/leaderboard) as a solo project (ranked 97th of 1324 - Top 8%, achieved Bronze medal) and I am participating in [GAN project in 2021 Deep Learning Competition](https://github.com/haenara-shin/GAN_Project)(South Korea) with the coolest, 2 other teammates. And, thankfully, we won a contest (1st place: Awarded for the Commissioner of the Korean Intellectual Property Office Award - 'ÌäπÌóàÏ≤≠Ïû•ÏÉÅ' in Korean) üéâ. In addition, I struggled with the financial domain problem which is the [Optiver Realized Volitility Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/optiver-realized-volatility-prediction/overview) in Kaggle (Public LB ranking (28/3965 (Top 1% - Sept. 28 2021 - This is the final submission deadline)). Starting after the final submission deadline there will be periodic updates to the leaderboard to reflect market data updates that will be run against selected notebooks. 

Research Interests
------
* Machine Learning (Deep Learning) + Materials Science Application
  * ML(DL) application/analysis to existing Materials science data/problems
* Deep Learning for the image recognition(Computer Vision) and/or TimeSeries dataset model building (plus MLOps).
* Solving the real-world problems through ML/DL application

* Before studying the ML, I was just focusing on traditional research of photo-electronic devices. I spent most of time in the cleanroom with vacuum deposition machines when I work at the company. Basically, it was similar when I started my PhD program. However, once I have to make a huge decision for changing my career path, and at the moment that I believe this would be the second chance, I just jumped into the ML world without any hesitation. I believe the ML application to Materials Science can be beyond my experience and expectation. Always, welcome to the new research field :)

Seeking Positions
------
* I am looking for the full-time job position focused on the Machine Learning/Deep Learning researcher/engineer, and I am willing to take a journey to a PhD again. 


Fun Facts about me
------
* Since 2006, I have been doing weight-lifting and bodybuilding. I won the bodybuilding competition in Daejeon, S.Korea, and my big three record was 585kg (1290lbs). Due to COVID-19, the record is decreased to 500kg, but let's keep going!
* The motivation of my enthusiasm toward the weight-lifting and bodybuilding came from the Herniated disc in 2004. I couldn't move at all, in the dormitory, I was devasted and it almost killed me, but I have learned that the health is the most important thing to do something. In addition, I like hiking, climbing, soccer, jogging, and healthy food. Sound body, sound mind!
* Before April 2019, I barely knew how to 'code'. I was just the expert of photovoltaics and photoelectronic devices. Once I decided to change my career path, although I am still trying to learn everything related to Computer Science and Machine Learning, and even though I am still struggling to get over the tasks in every course that I have taken, I have been proving to myself that I can make it :)
