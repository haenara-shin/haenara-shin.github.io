I am a graduate student majoring in both MS program for the Machine Learning and Data Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering and the PhD program in Materials Science and Engineering at UCSD. I obtained my fisrt MS for Materials Science and Engineering from KAIST in 2011, and BS for Materials Science and Engineering from KAIST in 2009, minored in Chemistry. From 2011 to 2015, I worked at the PV industry as a researcher who was in charge of the thin-film deposition, the defect/passivation analysis, and the high-efficient p/n-type c-Si solar cells fabrication.

Now, I will complete the second MS degree in WI21, and I am seeking the PhD student position, again!

Research Interests
------
* Machine Learning (Deep Learning) + Materials Science Application
  * Traditional ML(DL) application to Materials science
    * Building the model to predict the suitable materials for photovoltaics or energy storage applications. 
    * Expandable to the photoelectronic devices' materials, energy grid system or power generation system.
    * Expandable to the EL, PL, SEM, or other images' recognition to provide the new insight.
* Deep Learning to the image recognition
  * Image recognition (classification, localization, or segmentation)
    * Applied to the real-world, i.e., the photovoltaics' PL/EL classification/prediction, Face/Object/Anomaly recognition/detection.
    * Expandable to the real-world applications.

* Before studying the ML, I was just focusing on traditional research of photo-electronic devices. I spent most of time in the cleanroom with vacuum deposition machines when I work at the company. Basically, it was similar when I started my PhD program. However, once I have to make a huge decision for changing my career path, and at the moment that I believe this would be the second chance, I just jumped into the ML world without any hesitation. I believe the ML application to Materials Science can be beyond my experience and expectation. Always, welcome to the new research field :)

Seeking Positions
------
* I am seeking the PhD student position under the professor who does the research on the Machine Learning and Materials Science application.
  * I admitted the PhD program in 2017 Fall, UCSD, but I stopped it for one year, in order to study the Machine Learning, MS program. 
  * Now, I hope to resume my PhD journey again with a full of passion and interesting in new-field, the Machine Learning, and in my old friend, the Materials Science.
* I am also looking for the internship related to the Machine Learning (Optical Character Recognition, Image recognition, and Materials Science application). 

Fun Facts about me
------
* Since 2006, I have been doing weight-lifting and bodybuilding. I won the bodybuilding competition in Daejeon, S.Korea, and my big three record was 585kg (1290lbs). Due to COVID-19, the record is decreased to 500kg, but let's keep going!
* The motivation of my enthusiasm toward the weight-lifting and bodybuilding came from the Herniated disc in 2004. I couldn't move at all, in the dormitory, I was devasted and it almost killed me, but I have learned that the health is the most important thing to do something. In addition, I like hiking, climbing, soccer, jogging, and healthy food. Sound body, sound mind!
* Before April 2019, I barely knew how to 'code'. I was just the expert of photovoltaics and photoelectronic devices. Once I decided to change my career path, although I am still trying to learn everything related to Computer Science and Machine Learning, and even though I am still struggling to get over the tasks in every course that I have taken, I have been proving to myself that I can make it :)
